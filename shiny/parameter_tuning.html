A common use for rating prediction models is to predict
the users' ratings for movies they haven't seen yet. In
a simple popularity model, in which we predict users rate
movies according to the average rating for that movie,
regularization leads to better predictions. After splitting
the MovieLens dataset into a 90% training set and a 10%
test set, predictions were made on the test set for
various values of lambda, plotted above.
