<html>The Bottom 10 movies have a similar pattern as the Top 10 in that as lambda increases, movies with a few ratings
are replaced with more reliably bad movies, as expected. However, unlike in the Top 10
there are many movies which stay stably in the Bottom 10
even as lambda increases. One hypothesis for why this is the
case is that there are no bad movies with incredibly high
sample sizes. Good movies are rewatched and re-rated, so the
sample size gets very large whereas bad movies a simply watched
less. As a result, regularization is less impactful.
