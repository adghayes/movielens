<html>Observe how the the Top 10 movies change as the regularization parameter changes. With no regularization the Top
10 are all fairly obscure movies with very few, albeit positive, reviews. As the regularization parameter increases
these movies are displaced by better-known movies recognizable
from any top movie list like <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?groups=top_250&sort=user_rating">IMDb's.</a>
