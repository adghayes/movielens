<html> The data used in this applet is  the famous <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/">MovieLens
    dataset</a> of users' movie ratings. Here we use the recommended 20 million record dataset. In the above plot, "Movie Effect" is the deviation of a movie's average rating from the overall average
rating.<br><br><a href="https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/large-datasets.html#regularization"><b>Regularization</b></a>
is the process of normalizing group statistics based on sample size. In the case of movie effects, it means regressing a
movie's effect back to overall mean effect (by definition, 0) for small sample sizes. Without doing so, our results indicate that
the best movies, by movie effect, are movies that have only a handful of five star ratings. This is problematic
for estimating the true movie effect for any movie with few ratings. With regularization, each movie's effect is
calculated with an added parameter, lambda, in the denominator, and in this applet you can experiment with different
values of lambda. For a more formal summary of the problem and process of predicting movie means check out the
associated report on <a href="https://github.com/adghayes/movielens/blob/master/report.pdf">my github</a>.<br><br>Above you can see that with no adjustment, lambda = 0, many
of our "Top" movies have small sample sizes. As you increase lambda, you will see the "Top" movies shift toward
the more popular movies.
